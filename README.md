# A LOSSLESS IMAGE COMPRESSION ALGORITHM USING VARIABLE BLOCK SIZE SEGMENTATION

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the this python based web application locally on the machine.

## Description

[This Web Application Can Compress Images Without Loss of Image Features [Lossless Compression].
Users Can Upload an Image For This Application, and The Application Will Compress It Using a Lossless Image Compression Algorithm Using Variable Block Size Segmentation.]
